    <h2>🫨Black Hole 🫨</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A black hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. Black holes are formed when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle.</p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What is a black hole?</li>
      <li>How are black holes formed?</li>
      <li>Why is it called a black hole?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Black holes can come in different sizes, from small to supermassive.</li>
      <li>They can distort time and space around them due to their immense gravity.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🤯Exoplanets🤯</h2>
    <img src="black-hole_123321.webp" width="300" alt="Image of an Exoplanet">

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An exoplanet is any planet beyond our solar system. Most of them orbit other stars, but some, called rogue planets, float freely in space. More than 5,600 exoplanets have been confirmed so far, but scientists believe there are billions out there.</p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What is an exoplanet?</li>
      <li>How do scientists discover exoplanets?</li>
      <li>What types of exoplanets exist?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Some exoplanets are similar to Earth and could potentially harbor life.</li>
      <li>Others are gas giants like Jupiter, much larger than Earth.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🌎Comparison: Black Hole vs Exoplanet🪐</h2>
    <img src="solar-system-soso.jpeg" width="300" alt="Comparison Image">

    <h3>Key Differences</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A black hole is a region in space with extreme gravity, while an exoplanet is a planet outside our solar system.</li>
      <li>Black holes are formed from collapsing stars, but exoplanets form around stars or freely float in space.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Black holes consume everything that comes near them, while exoplanets may support life.</li>
      <li>Exoplanets can be observed directly, but black holes can only be detected indirectly by their effects on nearby objects.</li>
    </ol>
